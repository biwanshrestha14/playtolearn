          <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">Play 2 Learn</span> is an educational initiative designed to spark{' '}
          <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">curiosity</span> in
          young children through <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">playful and engaging activities</span>. Rather than using
          traditional teaching methods, our approach focuses on <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">learning through
          play</span>; helping children explore, ask questions, and enjoy the process of
          discovering new things.
          <br /><br />
          At the heart of the program are trained youth volunteers, known as
          "<span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">Learning Buddies</span>," who guide children through games that encourage
          <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">curiosity, creativity, and joy</span>. Learning Buddies are recent SEE
          graduates, high school students, undergraduate or graduate level students
          primarily from Makwanpaur district.
          <br /><br />
          Play 2 Learn operates in schools through short sessions that include a
          variety of <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">age-appropriate games and activities</span>. These sessions are
          designed to fit into the school day without disrupting the regular
          routine. The games are carefully selected to keep children engaged while
          promoting skills such as <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">observation, thinking, and problem-solving</span>.
          <br /><br />
          Our core belief is that <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">curiosity is a natural gift</span> in every child and by
          nurturing it early, we help build a strong foundation for <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">lifelong
          learning</span>. At its core, Play 2 Learn is about preserving and promoting one
          of the most powerful gifts we all share â€” <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">curiosity</span>.
