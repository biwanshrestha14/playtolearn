            Play 2 Learn is run by young people, for young people. Our vision is to provide a unique model of learning to young children which is interesting and easy to grasp. We inspire young volunteers to make a meaningful impact in their communities by engaging with one of the most important causes: education. We believe that with good ideas and a sincere heart, anyone can contribute to positive change.

            Our focus is not to teach in the traditional sense, but to inspire a love of learning; encouraging children to explore, question, and grow with confidence. Additionally, through our program, we equip volunteers (Learning Buddies) with the skills to lead playful, curiosity-driven activities that bring joy to young children and spark their interest in learning.

            We strive to inspire a sense of social responsibility in our volunteers.
